# Java menu driven calculator â€“ A Hands-On Learning Project

## ðŸš€ About This Project
This is not just another calculator. This project was built as part of my journey to **master Java fundamentals**, explore **console-based input/output**, and strengthen my understanding of **methods, loops, and modular programming**. Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate how a small program can elegantly combine logic, error handling, and user interaction.

I built this project to challenge myself:  
- Can I make a calculator that doesnâ€™t crash even if a user divides by zero?  
- Can I structure the code so each operation has its own clear method?  
- Can I keep the user experience simple but robust?

The result is a clean, menu-driven console calculator that keeps running until the user chooses to exit.

## ðŸŒŸ Features & Highlights
- **Modular Methods:** Each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is encapsulated in its own method for clarity and reusability.  
- **Dynamic User Input:** Uses `Scanner` to take user inputs at runtime.  
- **Error Handling:** Division by zero is caught gracefully with a user-friendly message.  
- **Loop-Driven Menu:** The calculator allows continuous operations until the user decides to quit.  
- **Human-Centric Design:** Designed for real usersâ€”no crashes, just smooth calculations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I deepened my knowledge of:
- **Java Syntax & Methods:** Writing clean, readable, and reusable code  
- **Conditional Logic & Loops:** Building interactive programs that respond to user input  
- **Error Handling:** Predicting and handling runtime errors like divide-by-zero  
- **Practical Programming Mindset:** Writing code that is easy to maintain and extend

javac Calculator.java

# Run the program
java Calculator 

```
--> Sample Run 
=== Java Console Calculator ===

Choose operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit
Enter choice: 1
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 8
Result = 20.0

Choose operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit
Enter choice: 4
Enter first number: 15
Enter second number: 0
Error: Division by zero is not allowed !

Choose operation:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit
Enter choice: 5
Calculator exited. Thank you!
